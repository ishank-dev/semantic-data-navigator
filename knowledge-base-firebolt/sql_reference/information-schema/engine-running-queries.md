# Information schema for engine running queries

You can use the `information_schema.engine_running_queries` view to return information about queries, executed by current user, currently running in a database. The view is available in each database and contains one row for each running query in the database. You can use a `SELECT` query to return information about each running query as shown in the example below.
The table is limited to a maximum of 10,000 queries per engine cluster.

If the user has the `MONITOR USAGE` privilege, they can view all queries running on the engine.


```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
   information_schema.engine_running_queries
LIMIT
  100;
```
