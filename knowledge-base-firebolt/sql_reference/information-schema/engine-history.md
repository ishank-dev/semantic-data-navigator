# Information schema for engine history

You can use the `information_schema.engine_history` view to return information about each engine's history in an account. The view shows operations performed on each engine, including creation, deletion, starts, stops, resizing, and logical operations like renames. It is often useful to filter this view to a particular engine. In the example below, a filter is applied to look at the history of engines starting with `capacity_test_`. By default, shows the events from the last 30 days.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  information_schema.engine_history
WHERE
  engine_name LIKE 'capacity_test_%'
```
